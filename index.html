        	<h3>Almonds are nutrient-rich seeds from the fruit of the almond tree (Prunus dulcis), widely valued for their flavor, versatility, and health benefits. Often eaten raw, roasted, or used in products like almond milk, almond butter, and almond flour, they are a popular ingredient in both sweet and savory dishes. Packed with protein, healthy fats, fiber, vitamins, and minerals, almonds support heart health, aid in energy, and make a convenient snack. Their long history stretches back thousands of years, with origins in the Middle East, and today they are one of the most widely cultivated and consumed nuts worldwide.</h3>

					<h3>Did you know?</h3>
					<p>In addition to their nutritional value, almonds play a significant role in agriculture and sustainability. California produces about 80% of the world’s almonds, making it a major driver of the state’s economy, though almond farming is often discussed in relation to its high water usage. Beyond food, almonds are also used in cosmetic products—almond oil is prized for its moisturizing properties and is commonly found in skincare and haircare formulations. With their versatility spanning from culinary applications to health and beauty, almonds continue to be a globally important crop with both cultural and economic impact.					</p>
